# 🛒 DMart Clone – Full Stack E-Commerce Platform

This is a full-stack clone of [DMart.in](https://www.dmart.in) built as a **learning-focused prototype** and **technical skills showcase**.  
The project is structured as a **monorepo** with both backend and frontend code organized under one repository.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This e-commerce platform demonstrates a scalable and modular architecture using:

- 🔙 **Spring Boot** (Java) as the backend REST API
- 🖥 **React.js** as the frontend UI
- 💽 **MySQL** with a database-first approach for schema design

This application replicates the core functionalities of a modern e-commerce platform, including:

- User registration & login
- Product catalog browsing
- Cart management
- Order placement
- Address handling
- Role-based access (Admin & Customer)


> 🛠️ Built using a **database-first approach**, where the data model forms the backbone of application logic.

> ✅ This project follows the full Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), including business requirements, design documentation, implementation, and future scalability considerations.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

- To **demonstrate enterprise-grade coding practices**
- Serve as a **prototype** for scalable e-commerce systems
- Practice full-stack development with clean separation of concerns
- Present a ready-to-show project for **interviews, portfolio**, or **client POCs**
