📌 Summary
A clone of www.dmart.in needs a robust backend composed of scalable microservices, a fast frontend, real-time order and inventory management, and secure payment & user authentication. You can start with a monolithic MVP and gradually split into services.


DATABASE THINKING

🧠 1. Start with Business Objectives
Ask: “What are the business goals this data needs to support?”

Is it high-frequency order processing?

Personalized recommendations?

Fast product search and filtering?

Real-time stock updates?

🗣️ In meetings: “Let’s clarify the core user journeys — is speed more critical than consistency for cart actions?”

🧩 2. Define the Domain: Think in Bounded Contexts
Break the domain into logical subdomains (from DDD - Domain-Driven Design):

Catalog (products, categories)

Cart and Checkout

Orders and Payments

Shipping and Fulfillment

Accounts and Users

🗣️ “I’m thinking we separate catalog from order processing to reduce coupling and allow independent scaling.”

🧱 3. Model the Core Entities First
Start small. Define canonical models:

What’s a "Product"?

What’s a "User"?

What’s an "Order"?

Think of:

Attributes

Relationships (1:1, 1:N, N:N)

Life cycle (e.g., how an order evolves)

🗣️ “Can we agree on the life cycle states of an Order first? That will influence how we model transitions and storage.”

⚖️ 4. Balance Consistency, Availability, and Partitioning
This is your CAP theorem moment.

For each subdomain, ask:

Do we need strong consistency? (e.g., payment records)

Can we tolerate eventual consistency? (e.g., wishlist updates)

What’s the expected read/write pattern?

🗣️ “For inventory, I suggest prioritizing consistency — one wrong stock count can break the user experience.”

🔄 5. Design for Change (Extensibility)
Always ask:

Will we add new payment methods?

Will the product model need variants or localization?

Can promotions or shipping rules change frequently?

Model entities with extension in mind:

Use JSONB fields or EAV (Entity-Attribute-Value) where flexibility is critical

Abstract shared logic (e.g., “Discountable” interface)

🗣️ “Let’s avoid locking ourselves in. Can we use a flexible product schema to support future variants or vendors?”

⚙️ 6. Think in Workflows, Not Just Tables
Model based on real workflows:

Cart → Checkout → Order → Payment

Product Listing → Search → Add to Cart

This helps you visualize state transitions, bottlenecks, and ownership of data.

🗣️ “When a user checks out, several modules touch data — we should think in terms of event-driven orchestration here.”

📊 7. Support Analytics and Reporting from Day 1
Always think:

What metrics will be tracked?

Will BI tools query this DB?

Can we export to a data lake?

Design data schemas that capture events, timestamps, and audit trails.

🗣️ “We’ll need to record each status change of the order for downstream analytics — better to plan that upfront.”

🛡️ 8. Secure and Compliant Design
In every meeting, bring in:

Data classification (PII, PCI, internal)

Access control (RBAC, data masking)

Audit logging

🗣️ “Since we're storing address and card data, we should isolate PII and tokenize payment info — maybe even use a separate vault DB.”

🔍 9. Test Scalability via Future Scenarios
Play out future growth:

“What if we go from 1K to 1M users?”

“How will search behave with 100K products?”

“Can we support 1K concurrent checkouts?”

Design schemas and indexes with horizontal scaling in mind.

🗣️ “Let’s assume we’ll have flash sales — we need to ensure inventory locking handles 1000 concurrent updates.”

🎯 10. Build a Vocabulary and Mental Map
During meetings, speak using structured terms:

“Eventually consistent view of stock count”

“Denormalization trade-off for search speed”

“Product entity designed for schema evolution”

“Separation of read and write models”

This shows clarity, depth, and readiness for scale — MAANG-level thinking.

💬 How to Communicate Your Design in Meetings
Here’s a structure you can reuse in discussions:

1. Start with the user story or business goal
2. Identify the core entities and relationships
3. Mention scaling concerns (volume, frequency)
4. Highlight key trade-offs (e.g., performance vs. consistency)
5. Discuss how it supports extensibility
6. Cover security and compliance
7. Show how it supports analytics and operational visibility
🗣️ Example: “For the product catalog, we’ll use a relational model for core attributes, but keep extensible fields like specs or filters in a JSONB column. That gives us structure with flexibility. Search will be offloaded to Elasticsearch for better performance.



1. Data Modeling
Entities to define clearly:

Users (customers, admins)
Products (with variants, categories, tags)
Orders and Order Items
Payments
Shipping and Billing Addresses
Reviews and Ratings
Shopping Cart and Wishlists
Inventory/Stock
Promotions/Discounts/Coupons

Use ER modeling or UML diagrams to define relationships and constraints (e.g., one-to-many, many-to-many).

2. Normalization vs. Denormalization

Normalize to avoid redundancy and ensure data integrity (up to 3NF typically).
Denormalize when:
Performance is impacted (e.g., read-heavy queries).
Caching and analytics require flatter data models.

3. Scalability and Performance
Choose between:

Relational databases (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL) for transactional consistency.

NoSQL databases (e.g., MongoDB, Cassandra) for flexible schemas and horizontal scaling.

Use:

Indexes (on search fields, foreign keys, etc.).
Partitioning/Sharding for large tables.
Read Replicas for high-traffic read operations.

4. Security

Encrypt sensitive data (e.g., passwords, payment info).
Use prepared statements or ORMs to prevent SQL injection.
Implement role-based access control.
Mask or tokenize PII where needed.

5. Transactions and Consistency
Support for ACID transactions, especially in orders and payments.
Use distributed transactions if multiple services/databases are involved.

6. Auditing and Logging
Track changes (e.g., order status updates, stock changes).
Maintain created_at, updated_at timestamps on key tables.
Add change logs for audit trails (e.g., table order_history).

7. Search and Filtering
Desig schema to support:
Full-text search (e.g., product name, description).
Faceted filtering (e.g., by price range, brand, rating).
Consider integrating Elasticsearch or Solr for advanced search.

8. Analytics and Reporting
Maintain separate tables or pipelines for:
Sales reporting
User behavior analytics
Consider data warehousing (e.g., BigQuery, Redshift) for reporting.

9. Inventory and Stock Management
Track product stock in real-time.
Handle race conditions using locking or atomic counters.
Sync stock updates across services (e.g., when order is placed or canceled).

10. Integrations
Support integrations with:
Payment gateways (e.g., Stripe, Razorpay)
Shipping providers (e.g., FedEx, Shiprocket)
External APIs for tax calculation, currency exchange, etc.
Maintain integration-related data separately.

Bonus: Tech Stack Consideration
ORM: Hibernate (Java)
API Layer: Spring Boot (REST APIs)
DB Options:
RDBMS: PostgreSQL, MySQL
NoSQL: MongoDB (for product catalogs, session data)
Cache: Redis (for sessions, cart, quick lookups)
